    Waterway Labs founder James Beadle has family members who utilise and work in the social care system in the UK, seeing the issues that exist first hand.
    </p>
  <p>
    We have worked directly with carers to scope a comprehensive care solution that meets the standards required by the UK based regulatory body, the CQC (Care Quality Commision).
  </p>
  <p>
    The Waterway Labs team is in the process of expansion, bringing on a new Managing & Operations Director in June 2024. This allows James to focus on the development of OpenCare.

  <p>Other team members will be announced in the coming months.</p>
